# Castelló pollution

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `Castelló pollution` is to showcase a basic processing and
analysis workflow for time series in long format across different
sensors using R.

Particularly, a mean-value filling of missing value was performed for a
single pollution sensor through time and an Long Short-Term Memory Model
was run for this particular time series. The project scope is year 2023.

The workflow is available at the [`Analysis.md`](Analysis.md) document
in this repository.
